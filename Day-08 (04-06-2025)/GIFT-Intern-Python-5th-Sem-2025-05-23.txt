    =   Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s
        and officially released in 1991. Here's a summary of how and why Python was created:

    =   The Python programming language is named after the British comedy troupe Monty
        Python's Flying Circus, says Sifars. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python,
        was a fan of the show and wanted a short, unique, and slightly mysterious name
        for the language. The name "Python" also reflects van Rossum's goal of making
        the language easy to learn and use, says Teradata.

    =   üìú Background and Motivation
        In the late 1980s, van Rossum was working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
        in the Netherlands.

    =   He had worked on a project called ABC, a teaching language designed to be simple
        and easy to learn. However, ABC had limitations and lacked extensibility.

    =   Frustrated with ABC‚Äôs shortcomings, van Rossum wanted to build a new scripting
        language that retained ABC‚Äôs ease of use but added more flexibility, power, and
        extensibility.

    =   üõ†Ô∏è Development of Python
        During a Christmas break in 1989, van Rossum began developing Python as a hobby
        project.

    =   His goals were:
        >   Easy and intuitive syntax.
        >   Code readability and simplicity.
        >   Support for exception handling.
        >   Interfacing with the Amoeba distributed operating system (which he worked on).

    =   Extensibility using C.
        The name ‚ÄúPython‚Äù was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python‚Äîvan
        Rossum wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, not after
        the snake.

    =   üöÄ First Release
        Python 1.0 was released in February 1991 on the alt.sources newsgroup.

        It included:
        >   Exception handling.
        >   Functions and modules.
        >   Core data types like lists, strings, and dictionaries.
        >   Basic object-oriented features.

    =   üìà Evolution and Impact
        Python gradually grew in popularity through the 1990s and 2000s due to its
        simplicity and versatility.

    =   Major milestones:
        >   Python 2.0 in 2000 introduced garbage collection and list comprehensions.
        >   Python 3.0 in 2008 broke backward compatibility to fix design flaws and
            streamline the language.
        >   Today, Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), with
            contributions from a large global community.

    =   üåç Why It Matters
        Python is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the world,
        especially in fields like:

        Web development
        Data science
        Machine learning
        Automation
        Education

    =   Guido van Rossum is often referred to as Python's "Benevolent Dictator For Life"
        (BDFL), a title he held until he stepped down from the role in 2018.

    =   Let me know if you'd like a timeline or infographic of Python‚Äôs history!

    =   PYTHON KEYWORDS

    =   What is a range?
        The range() function in Python returns a range object, which is an immutable
        sequence of numbers. It does not return a list or tuple directly. This object
        is memory-efficient because it generates numbers on demand rather than storing
        them all in memory at once.

        The range() function can be used in several ways:
        >   range(stop): Generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) stop.
        >   range(start, stop): Generates numbers from start up to (but not including) stop.
        >   range(start, stop, step): Generates numbers from start up to (but not including)
            stop, incrementing by step.
        >   The range object can be iterated over using a for loop or converted into a
            list or tuple using the list() or tuple() functions, respectively.

    =   Rules for Python variables:
        >   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
            [A-Z,a-z,_]
        >   A variable name cannot start with a digit
        >   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
            (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        >   Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different
            variables)
        >   A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

    =   Built-in data types in Python are fundamental data types that are readily available
        for use without requiring any additional libraries or modules. Here's a breakdown
        of the common built-in data types:
        >   Numeric Types:
            int: Represents integer values (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
            float: Represents floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5, 0.0).
            complex: Represents complex numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., 2+3j).
        >   Text Type:
            str: Represents sequences of characters (e.g., "hello", 'world').
        >   Sequence Types:
            list: Ordered, mutable collections of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']).
            tuple: Ordered, immutable collections of items (e.g., (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c')).
            range: Represents a sequence of numbers (e.g., range(5) generates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
        >   Mapping Type:
            dict: Represents collections of key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}).
        >   Set Types:
            set: Unordered collections of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
            frozenset: Immutable version of set.
        >   Boolean Type:
            bool: Represents boolean values, either True or False.
        >   Binary Types:
            bytes: Immutable sequences of single bytes (e.g., b'hello').
            bytearray: Mutable sequences of single bytes.
            memoryview: Allows access to the internal data of an object without copying.

        These data types form the foundation for working with data in Python. Each type
        has its own properties and methods, allowing you to perform various operations
        based on the type of data you are working with.

    =   Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
        >   Text Type:	    str
        >   Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
        >   Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
        >   Mapping Type:	dict
        >   Set Types:	    set, frozenset
        >   Boolean Type:	bool
        >   Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
        >   None Type:	    NoneType

    =   Getting the Data Type
        You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

    =   Setting the Data Type
        In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

        Example	Data Type
            x = "Hello World"	                            str
            x = 20	                                        int
            x = 20.5	                                    float
            x = 1j	                                        complex
            x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	            list
            x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	            tuple
            x = range(6)	                                range
            x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	            dict
            x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	            set
            x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	frozenset
            x = True	                                    bool
            x = b"Hello"	                                bytes
            x = bytearray(5)	                            bytearray
            x = memoryview(bytes(5))	                    memoryview
            x = None	                                    NoneType

    =   Setting the Specific Data Type
        If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor
        functions:

        Example	Data Type
            x = str("Hello World")	                        str	
            x = int(20)	                                    int	
            x = float(20.5)	                                float	
            x = complex(1j)	                                complex	
            x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	        list	
            x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	    tuple	
            x = range(6)	                                range	
            x = dict(name="John", age=36)	                dict	
            x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	        set	
            x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	frozenset	
            x = bool(5)	                                    bool	
            x = bytes(5)	                                bytes	
            x = bytearray(5)	                            bytearray	
            x = memoryview(bytes(5))	                    memoryview

        Modules in Python are files containing Python code, which can include 
        functions, classes, and variables. Python modules can be imported into
        other Python programs, allowing you to use the code defined within them.
        This avoids code duplication and promotes a modular approach to programming.

        Python has a standard library with many built-in modules that offer solutions
        to common programming problems. You can also create your own modules to 
        organize your code.

    =   What is OOPs (Object Oriented Programming)
        OOPs is a paradim, a way of writing computer programs.
        C++, Java, Python, ... are OOPs languages.

    =   In an OOPs language, there are 3 features:
        1)  Encapsulation
            When the programming code and the data are embedded together within one
            unit called a class, it is encapsulation
                class Name {            class Name:
                }                           # code

            Abstraction
                The technique to hide the visibility of a data member within a class
                from other classes is known as abstraction

        2)  Inheritance
            When the class inherits another class, and the code of the parent class
            may be used as if it has been written within the same class
                parent      super       base
                child       sub         derived

            Single Inheritance

                class Parent():
                    def __init__(self):
                        print("Hello World from Parent")

                class Child(Parent):
                    def __init__(self):
                        print("Hello World from Child")

                - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
            Multiple Inheritance

                class a():
                    def funcA():
                        print("This is a")

                class b(a):
                    def funcB():
                        print("This is b")

                class c(b):
                    def funcC():
                        print("This is c")

                class d(c,a):
                    def funcD():
                        print("This is d")

            Multilevel Inheritance

                +- a
                |  +- b
                |  |  +- c
                |  |  |  +- d


        3)  Polimorphism
            When functions/methods have similar name, it is polymorphism.
            There are 2 types of polymorphism:
            i)  Overloading
                When two or more methods have same name with different parameters in
                the same class, it is known as overloading

                class Example():
                    def work():
                        print("work")

                    def work(name):
                        print(name)

           ii)  Overriding
                When methods have same name are defined in the parent class and in
                the child class, it is known as overriding

                class Parent():
                    def assign():
                        print("Assignment")
                
                class Child(Parent):
                    def assign():
                        print("Redefined")

    =   What is error handling in Python?
        When there is an error during execution of a Python program, the compiler
        generates a message.

    =   Errors are handled in a statement called try-except-finally

    =   When an error occurs in the program, within the try block, an error object
        is generated. This object is matched with all the class type that is specified
        in the except clauses.

    =   PYTHON BUILT-IN EXCEPTIONS

    =   What is finally clause:
        The finally clause is associated with try statement.
        finally clause is optional. If the finally is present, the block associated
        with the finally clause is executed in either case, if there is an error or
        there is no error.
