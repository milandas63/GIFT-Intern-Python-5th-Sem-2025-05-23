    =   Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s
        and officially released in 1991. Here's a summary of how and why Python was created:

    =   The Python programming language is named after the British comedy troupe Monty
        Python's Flying Circus, says Sifars. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python,
        was a fan of the show and wanted a short, unique, and slightly mysterious name
        for the language. The name "Python" also reflects van Rossum's goal of making
        the language easy to learn and use, says Teradata. 

    =   üìú Background and Motivation
        In the late 1980s, van Rossum was working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
        in the Netherlands.

    =   He had worked on a project called ABC, a teaching language designed to be simple
        and easy to learn. However, ABC had limitations and lacked extensibility.

    =   Frustrated with ABC‚Äôs shortcomings, van Rossum wanted to build a new scripting
        language that retained ABC‚Äôs ease of use but added more flexibility, power, and
        extensibility.

    =   üõ†Ô∏è Development of Python
        During a Christmas break in 1989, van Rossum began developing Python as a hobby
        project.

    =   His goals were:
        >   Easy and intuitive syntax.
        >   Code readability and simplicity.
        >   Support for exception handling.
        >   Interfacing with the Amoeba distributed operating system (which he worked on).

    =   Extensibility using C.
        The name ‚ÄúPython‚Äù was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python‚Äîvan
        Rossum wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, not after
        the snake.

    =   üöÄ First Release
        Python 1.0 was released in February 1991 on the alt.sources newsgroup.

        It included:
        >   Exception handling.
        >   Functions and modules.
        >   Core data types like lists, strings, and dictionaries.
        >   Basic object-oriented features.

    =   üìà Evolution and Impact
        Python gradually grew in popularity through the 1990s and 2000s due to its
        simplicity and versatility.

    =   Major milestones:
        >   Python 2.0 in 2000 introduced garbage collection and list comprehensions.
        >   Python 3.0 in 2008 broke backward compatibility to fix design flaws and 
            streamline the language.
        >   Today, Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), with
            contributions from a large global community.

    =   üåç Why It Matters
        Python is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the world,
        especially in fields like:

        Web development
        Data science
        Machine learning
        Automation
        Education

    =   Guido van Rossum is often referred to as Python's "Benevolent Dictator For Life"
        (BDFL), a title he held until he stepped down from the role in 2018.

    =   PYTHON KEYWORDS
        Python has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be
        used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers:
